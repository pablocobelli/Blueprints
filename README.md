# Blueprints
Template managing and deploying via git.

## Usage
svn checkout https://github.com/pablocobelli/Blueprints/trunk/blueprintname .

replacing 'blueprintname' with the name of the blueprint you wish to deploy.

The dot at the end of the line performs the checkout to the current directory,
without creating the folder. If you want to create the folder explicitly,
remove the dot at the end of the line.
